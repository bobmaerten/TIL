# Remove a cached 301 redirection http -> https

I struggled a lot to remove a cached 301 redirection from a http to https version of a site. I had his site redirect http to https but I reverted to http since nothing was worth encrypting specifically for this site.

But in the end, I find myself greppin' around my firefox profile to remove this site from the `SiteSecurityServiceState.txt` file, after using History search panel to select this site and 'Forget all about this site'.

Hope it helps.
